# Tukey-to-ggplots
## An improved function to add significance letters to plots generated by ggplot. 

There are several functions around that essentially take levels from a Tukey test result and convert them to letters that can be added to ggplot. Aim of this project is to build up on those funtions and create a definitivefunction working with any data set and any plot similarly to a geom_stats
